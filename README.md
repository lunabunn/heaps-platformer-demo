# Heaps Platformer Demo

Simple platformer demo written in Heaps/Haxe.
Not commented (for now), not optimized (nor does it claim to be), and may contain not-very-good coding practices.

Has out-of-the-box support for AABB collision check & resolution and basic player controller with smooth accel/deccel and customizable number of jumps.

PR/issue welcome; may or may not be revisited in the future.

Tested with Haxe 4.0.0-rc.5, Heaps [git](https://github.com/HeapsIO/heaps/tree/b66d51e013b0e6630154d4cb062ad4c8345bace9), and hashlink/hlsdl 1.10.0 on macOS Mojave 10.14.6.
